Hello, person reading this text!
Welcome to the Shader Forge Alpha, and thanks for signing up to test it!

You hopefully want to get going instantly, but please read this document first, it's not that long!

Important Legal stuff:
----------------------
- This is a test version solely for testing purposes, not a free license of Shader Forge, which means:
- Don't use shaders created in Shader Forge in a public project
- Don't share the code it creates to anyone apart from the alpha/beta testers
- Don't give this test version to anyone or publish it online etc
(Note that you are of course welcome (and encouraged) to share screenshots of Shader Forge and screenshots of shaders you've created in it publicly!)



Installing:
-----------
Open a Unity project -> Double click the .unitypackage file you got in your mail
Unity plugins are per-project, so open the project you want to test the Shader Forge alpha in



Quick start:
------------
Opening Shader Forge = Window -> Shader Forge
 	     Panning = Click and drag empty space
	     Zooming = (Coming later)
	Adding nodes = RMB + select node OR pick from right panel and place (Dragging doesn't work at the moment)
	Moving nodes = Click and drag
      Deleting nodes = Hover cursor over and press delete
Deleting connections = Hover cursor over and press delete



A few known issues: (More here: https://shaderforge.userecho.com/ )
-------------------
- Shaders can't receive shadows
- Vertex lighting is mostly broken
- Only a directional light and ambient light is supported 
- Loads of nodes are intentionally missing, check the feature list to see what is planned. If something is missing on that list, feel free to request it!



Good luck!
